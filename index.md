## Projects


##### [Time Series Analysis on Gasoline Demand (RStudio)](https://github.com/philipyoon/gas-demand-analysis)
Created a SARIMA model to forecast Ontario's gasoline demand using time series data. After a boxcox transformation and differencing at lags 1 and 12, the stationary dataâ€™s ACF and PACF were analyzed to estimate SARIMA models for forecasting. A stationary and invertible model was then chosen using MLE estimation of parameters, AICc criterion, and the principle of parsimony, which was then used to forecast Ontario's gasoline demand. The model did well; however, diagnostic checking indicated the results of said techniques were not perfect.

##### [Loan Eligibility Classification (Jupyter Notebook, Pycharm, Flask, Heroku)](https://github.com/philipyoon/loan_eligibility_predictor)
Identifed which customers would be eligible for loans given a dataset. Modeled and evaluated performances of logistic regression, SVM, and decision tree classifier using 10 fold cross validation scores. Deployed best model with Flask and Heroku so others can easily access them through an API. Using F1 performance metrics, logistic regression performed best.

##### [Physician Count Regression (RStudio)](https://github.com/philipyoon/physician_count_regression)
Project using regression analysis to investigate two linear models; both investigating the number of professionally active nonfederal physicians during 1990 and which demographic variables affected this count most.
