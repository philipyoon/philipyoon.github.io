  My name is Philip and I'm currently studying Applied Statistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My latest project is working on deploying a keras decision tree classifier model as an endpoint using flask. I am always looking to improve my technical skills, so please don't hesitate to give constructive critique.

  Other than work, I enjoy movies, rock climbing, and reading self-help and science fiction books. If you'd like to talk or connect about anything please reach out to me! yoonphilip99 (at) gmail (dot) com
