  I'm currently a 4th year at the University of California, Santa Barbara majoring in Statistics and Data Science looking for opportunities in analytics 
  and data science. My current learning goals are in using Apache Airflow to automate and schedule data pipeline tasks in combination 
  with visualization software like Tableau to create performance metric dashboards.
